<tr><td><p style="font-family:bradley hand;font-size:150%;">My name is Baylee and I have a beautiful 7 month old puppy named <b>Bindi</b>. She is my first dog I have ever raised alone and our past five months together have been so great. It has given me a chance to not only give a dog from the shelter a forever home, but has also given me a chance to care for a whole other life. The responsibility that comes with having a puppy was surprising and overwhelming at first, but I would not trade it for the world.</p>
<p style="font-family:bradley hand;font-size:150%;">I got Bindi in June when she was only eight weeks old and barely nine pounds. She was adopted at the Athens Area Humane Society, which has new animals everyday up for adoption. On this page, I've attached some of my favorite photoes of Bindi, old and new. She has been nothing but a blessing in my life! The walks we have, the cuddles, and the way she greets me at the door when I come home are just a few of the reasons I have never regretted taking on this new responsibility.</p></td>
